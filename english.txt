hello,how are you!
I am find,thank you!

I will run I will climb I will soar
I`m undeated
Jumping out of my skin pull the chord
Yeah I belive it
The past is everything we were dont make us who we are
So I`ll dream untill I make it real and all I see is stars
It`s not untill you fall that you fly
When you dream come alive you`re unstoppable 
Take a shot chase th sun find the beautiful
We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
And we`ll dream it possible
Possible
